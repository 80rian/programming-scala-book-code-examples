  <para>The animal on the cover of <citetitle>Programming Scala</citetitle> is
  a Malayan tapir (<emphasis>Tapirus indicus</emphasis>), also called an Asian
  tapir. It is a black-and-white hoofed mammal with a round, stocky body
  similar to that of a pig. At 6–8 feet long and 550–700 pounds, the Malayan
  is the largest of the four tapir species. It lives in tropical rain forests
  in Southeast Asia.</para>

  <para>The Malayan tapir’s appearance is striking: its front half and hind
  legs are solid black, and its midsection is marked with a white saddle. This
  pattern provides perfect camouflage for the tapir in a moonlit jungle. Other
  physical characteristics include a thick hide, a stumpy tail, and a short,
  flexible snout. Despite its body shape, the Malayan tapir is an agile
  climber and a fast runner.</para>

  <para>The tapir is a solitary and mainly nocturnal animal. It tends to have
  very poor vision, so it relies on smell and hearing as it roams large
  territories in search of food, tracking other tapirs’ scents and
  communicating via high-pitched whistles. The Malayan tapir’s predators are
  tigers, leopards, and humans, and it is considered endangered due to habitat
  destruction and overhunting.</para>
