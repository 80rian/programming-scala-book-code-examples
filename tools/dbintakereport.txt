Preliminary pagecount: xvi + 412 = 428

Notes:

** AUs wrote in asciidoc and did their own conversion to DocBook; I've
   cleaned up various idiosyncracies, but please let us know if you
   come across markup oddities as there's interest from ED in
   extending this model. (There may also be some lurking specialness
   in the sourcefiles aimed at the OFPS version, more on which below.)

** If there are markup/rendering ambiguities, keep in mind that AUs/ED
   may have been looking at several renditions: asciidoc, OFPS, Rough
   Cut, and PDF build from MS. A copy of the last can be found here
   for comparison if needed:
    
     https://prod.oreilly.com/internal/books/9780596155957/branches/manuscript_to_prod_20090707/pdf/book.xml.pdf

   and the OFPS version is here:

     http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/

** MS <bookinfo> contained an <abstract> and <legalnotice>, apparently
   for the OFPS version (where it appears above the TOC and includes a
   link to the catalog page for the Rough Cut). I'm appending this
   content for review: note that neither element rendered in MS PDF
   builds and I haven't added them to the current <bookinfo>
   (generated from PDB data, as usual).

** MS contains <tip>s, <note>s, <warning>s, and <cautions>s, which of
   course render in default Animal style using the two standard
   icons. Not clear if AUs may be expecting other differentiation (in
   OFPS, each has the element name as a label). I'm appending a census
   of where they occur, in case that helps.

** MS had table attributes apparently geared to OFPS display
   (including absolute column widths that were causing content to
   spill into margins); I've stripped all to give you default
   PDF rendering.

** AUs did not follow our guidelines for cross-refs to the
   pseudobibliography. In particular, our standard cleanup scripts
   stripped @xreflabel attributes on the targets (which wouldn't
   necessarily work downstream) that they were using for "see [Foo]"
   style. I've remapped such <xref>s to <link>s, but please proofread
   carefully.

** Index: incoming files had a couple of index entries; left as is.

** URLs: in ch14.xml, the following links fail. Each redirects to a page
   with a 403 error (unclear whether this is because they're part of a
   multistep download process that may work inside an installer, but not
   directly?):

     http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin redirected to
     http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin/
     Status: 301 -> 403 Forbidden
     The link is forbidden! This needs fixing. Usual suspects: a missing
     index.html or Overview.html, or a missing ACL. 

     http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly redirected to
     http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin-nightly/
     Status: 301 -> 403 Forbidden
     The link is forbidden! This needs fixing. Usual suspects: a missing
     index.html or Overview.html, or a missing ACL. 

   Otherwise, all links passed after some markup fixes. The full
   link-checkup report can be found here (showing the state of things
   midway through intake cleanup):
      
     tools/link_checkup_intake_internal.html 

   More gory details can be found in this cached copy of the W3C Link
   Checker report (from an intermediate stage, but nothing else here
   that you have to fix):

** Draft PDF is at pdf/drafts/intake.pdf

Please let me know about any other issues.

==========================================================

<abstract> 
  <para><citetitle>Programming Scala</citetitle> introduces
  an exciting new language that offers all the benefits of a modern
  object model, functional programming, and an advanced type
  system. Packed with code examples, this comprehensive book teaches
  you how to be productive with Scala quickly, and explains what makes
  this language ideal for today's highly scalable, component-based
  applications that support concurrency and distribution. You'll also
  learn the advantages that Scala offers as a language for the Java
  Virtual Machine. </para> <para>Learn more at <ulink
